## Split Precinct Maps
In 2017, Virginia had 23 precincts split by Congressional district boundaries, and 138 precincts split by House of Delegates district boundaries.  This means voters at the same location could be voting in two or three different House of Delegates races.
The 2017 set of precinct shapefiles includes:
- Map of precincts including Congressional district (CD) splits. This shapefile can be used to map the results of the statewide races for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, and Attorney General, which are reported by Congressional district.
- Map of precincts including House of Delegates district (HD) splits. This shapefile can be used to map the results for the 2017 House of Delegates election.

These maps are the same as the voting precinct shapefiles, but where district boundaries split a precinct, that precinct is two separate features in the shapefile. This way, election results can be mapped by both precinct and Congressional or House of Delegates district. This is useful if one wants to compare, for example, the two-party vote share in a given  election with census demographic data such as income, race, and education rates.
